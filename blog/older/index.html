Then I thought about how many people use Excel for nearly all of their business needs. So of course, that lead me to a “What If” moment: What if Excel had a =GetTax() function? Of course, I hadn’t used (or debugged) VBA in years. I had completely forgotten there were more leisurely activities, like eating a box of wood screws. Nevertheless, my stubborness to finish what I started lead to this...</p>

With the resources of Avalara’s Incubator team, we’ve launched a brand new site that offers a number of great improvements. Jekyll. With the old site, we were managing site plugins and platform-specific integrations. This was slowing us down, and slowing down the site. The new site is based on a static page generator, Jekyll, which allows us to manage things more easily and to load pages faster. Open source all the docs: Jekyll runs off of a series of markdown files, which we’ve made public on GitHub....</p>

This is our free and simple API for getting sales tax rates and authorities based on a street address or zip/postal code in the U.S. or Canada. The new node.js library makes it easy to integrate it into your node-based projects. You can find sample code in the readme of the TaxRates-node Github repository. You can also embed it in your node.js project: npm install avalara-taxrates. I cannot give a definitive statement on when our...</p>

                        <p class="blog-excerpt">Avalara just posted a new version of our AvaTax terms and conditions, effective January 1, 2016. New Ts and Cs are always an opportunity for some fun recreational reading, but these are especially exciting. From section 3.b.ii:  ii. If Customer does submit Documents to the AvaTax Service in a billing month, but usage of the AvaTax APIs or the number of invoice lines submitted significantly exceeds ordinary AvaTax usage in that month, the following calculations may be used to determine “Document” usage during that month: 1. Every 50 API calls to the address validation service will count as one “Document”; 2....</p>

There is still room for improvement, but we’ve had success with an open-source tool called Slate.

                        <p class="blog-excerpt">Did you know that most developers will tell you that Sales Tax can be determined by using zip code alone? They’re sorely mistaken as it takes more than just zip codes to determine accurate sales tax rates. My previous post illustrated that each jurisdiction can be determined by the local city or state officials depending on their own laws and needs. In my search to understand this concept, I came across the smallest Sales Tax Jurisdiction in the United States. As you can see, this jurisdiction covers only one building in the Hoisington City District and is sandwiched between the other jurisdictions....</p>

I’m also brought up in a simpler (tax wise) economy in Malaysia, where sales tax is pretty much straightforward.

                        <p class="blog-excerpt">The new AvaTax.js library makes it easy to calculate taxes with browser-based shopping carts and other web commerce environments – providing real-time tax calculation results during the checkout process. Those accurate, on-demand tax calculations can be consumed at time of checkout, allowing you to display the results to your shoppers or use them in your payment processing. This diagram is a typical process flow for an E-commerce scenario. Let’s take a look at an easy example where AvaTax.js can be used in conjunction with Stripe.js to calculate tax and create a payment authorization token. You’ll need to include the core...</p>

These address-related errors are to be expected in normal use of your connector. Sometimes it can be challenging to create this use case on purpose: our system is very good at validating addresses and calculating tax accordingly (albeit at lower precision levels).
