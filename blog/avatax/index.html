What does this error mean, and how should my code handle it? What's a Document Status? AvaTax checks the state of a transaction based on the code sent with a CreateTransaction request. As outlined in the previous blog posts Lifecycle of a Transaction and Type of Transactions, when you use a transaction type with a suffix of Invoice, AvaTax will record and save the transaction.

A Transaction can reflect one of many different types of business documents, and it’s worth discussing how a transaction can change over time. Let’s begin by understanding how a “Sales” transaction is created, and how it can change over time. The Transaction State Diagram In AvaTax, a sales transaction is an exchange that occurs between two companies. Although other types of transactions exist that can be within a single company - for example, inventory transfer transactions - in today’s use case we will only examine transactions that occur between two...</p>

In the United States, the rule that determines when your company has to obey a particular jurisdiction’s tax law is called ‘Nexus’, so AvaTax uses this word to refer to the overall concept of selecting jurisdictions where you are signed up to collect and remit taxes. Keep in mind, these rules have significant legal repercussions, and you should strongly consider getting legal or tax advice to ensure that your Nexus...</p>

In order to properly calculate taxes in these different circumstances, AvaTax must also support a wide variety of transaction types. In today’s article, I will walk you through the differences between these transactions and describe how to map them to your business processes.

Many businesses work by cash register day by day, and at the end of each month they produce a report listing all the transactions that they processed. Sometimes businesses will have one report for each location, or cash register, or salesperson; and they need a batch process they can use to upload all of these transactions into AvaTax for later reconciliation, or for filing tax returns....</p>
