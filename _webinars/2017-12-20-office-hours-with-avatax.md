Avalara’s crack team of engineers receives dozens of questions a week from the developers using our APIs, SDKs and documentation, and we want to answer as many as we can.

So, we’re setting aside our next free webinar to hold a special open, hour-long Q&A session where developers will get the chance to ask Avalara’s Ted Spence, Bob Erdman and Aaron Robles anything that happens to be top of  mind as we head into the New Year.

Want to know how to handle occasional network timeouts when calling AvaTax? Need to be able to tell the difference between the free tax rates API and the CreateTransaction API? Or maybe you’ve gotten stuck trying to reconcile a transaction that was calculated offline and need a little help crossing the finish line.

Ted, Bob and Aaron can answer all these questions and more, so be sure to register for the final developer webinar of the year, which will be held at 11 a.m. PT to noon PT on Wednesday, Dec. 20.

We’re looking forward to your questions!
